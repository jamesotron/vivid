# Vivid

Vivid is a simple 2D rendering library.

I plan to use it to render polygons for display on a
[monochrome 128x64 OLED display from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/938).

I've never done any graphics programming before, so I'm working my way through the 2D
portions of [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/index.htm)
and implementing them in Elixir as I go.

Expect this library to take a while to stabilise.
