# Vivid

Vivid is a simple 2D rendering library.

I plan to use it to render polygons for display on a
[monochrome 128x64 OLED display from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/938).

## Features.

  * Supports the following 2D drawing primitives:
    * Point
    * Line
    * Path
    * Polygon
    * Circle
    * Arc
  * Supports rasterizing primitives and placing them on a frame buffer.

## Status

This library is still experimental, but what few features it has work well.
